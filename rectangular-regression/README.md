# About

This portion of the repo contains my projects on mostly tabular datasets with a regression task at the end. This also includes the loading, preparation, feature selection, testing, validation and modeling with respect to the data. This is mostly done in an expository fashion, sprinkling my thoughts and insights on what I am uncovering along the way.
